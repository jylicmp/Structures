# Structures

Here we provide structures of the 72 candidates with correlation-enhanced SOC effect in the work 
[1] J. Li, Q. Yao, L. Wu, Z. Hu, B. Gao, X. Wan, and Q. Liu, Designing light-element materials with large effective spin-orbit coupling, [arXiv:2107.06691](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06691).
The structures are collected from the C2DB (https://cmrdb.fysik.dtu.dk/c2db/).
